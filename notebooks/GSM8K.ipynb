      "Tobias is buying a new pair of shoes that costs $95. He has been saving up his money each month for the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel? \n",

      "Tobias is buying a new pair of shoes that costs $95. He has been saving up his money each month for the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel? \n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "5 \n",
      "Response:\n",
      "To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initial Shoe Cost**: The shoes cost $95.\n",
      "2. **Monthly Savings**: Each month, Tobias earns $5 allowance, adds $7 for shoveling driveways, and then spends $15 on each lawn mowing.\n",
      "   - Total savings per month: $5 (allowance) + $7 (driving) = $12\n",
      "   - Contribution for mowing each lawn: $15\n",

      "   - Cost of mowing 4 lawns: $15 * 4 = $60\n",
      "   - Total savings per month: $12 + $60 = $72\n",

      "   - Savings after shoes and billing: $95 (total cost of shoes) + $15 (change) = $110\n",
      "4. **Subtracting Initial Savings**: Savings after shoes and billing - Savings per month: $110 - $72 = $38\n",
      "5. **Determine Number of Lawns mowed**: To find out how many driveways Tobias shoveled, divide the remaining savings by the cost per driveway:\n",
      "   - Number of driveways shoveled = $38 / $7 = 5.423\n",
      "6. **Repeating the Calculation for Driveways**: Since mowing doesn't need to be done in fractional steps, directly calculate the driveways he shoveled based on the formula:\n",

      "Natalia sold clips to 48 friends in April. \n",
      "To calculate the number of clips sold in May, we need to find half of what she sold in April. This means we divide the number of friends by 2.\n",
      "Number of friends in May = 48 / 2 = 24\n",
      "Number of clips sold in May = Number of friends in May / 2 = 24 / 2 = 12\n",

      "SOLUTION This problem involves calculating the total number of clips sold by Natalia in April and May. First, they need to determine the number of friends sold in April, which is 48. Then, they need to determine how many clips were sold in May, which is half the number of friends sold in April. Finally, they need to calculate the total number of clips by adding the number of clips sold in April and the number sold in May.\n",
